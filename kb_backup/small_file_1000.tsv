Why is this project being built?	The Laredo area is expected to add between 100,000 and 200,000 residents over the next 25 years\n–\nmost of these people are expected to locate to the north and east sides of the community. This facility is envisioned to serve the whole community by meeting needs without overburdening existing, already limited facilities. The new facility will provide a safer environment, reducing crashes and injuries.

How will the project improve safety for traffic on the roadway?	The proposed project will increase capacity (more lanes) to meet anticipated needs of growing traffic volumes. Without additional capacity, motorists will experience higher levels of congestion on parallel facilities like Loop 20.  Congestion creates stress and frustration among motorists, and in extreme cases can induce road rage.  Besides increasing capacity, the design will include medians that will keep vehicles traveling in opposite directions from crossing into each others’ lanes.
